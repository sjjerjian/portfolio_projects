# My portfolio projects

This repository is an ongoing development of small projects developed in my spare time. The goal of each project is to either explore applying a machine learning technique, explore a domain of interest or one of my hobbies, or practice a technical skill.


##Â Chess Games

I build a classification model to predict the winner of a chess game. One key feature is the rating difference between white and black, but I also attempt to use information about the opening played to see if that holds predictive power.

## Pizza Place Sales

Data from a fictional pizza store, with a simple schema containing tables on orders, order_details, pizzas and pizza_types. I use pgADMIN with PostgreSQL to build the schema and import the data from .csv files, and then answer some business questions to practice using SQL.

I formulate a few of my own questions, but I also provided the schema to ChatGPT and requested 15 questions of different difficulty levels.
