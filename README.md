# My portfolio projects

This repository is a live collection of small projects developed in my spare time. The goal of each project is to either explore applying a machine learning technique, explore a domain, topic, or dataset of personal interest, or practice a technical skill.

## Python 
- ### Chess Winner Prediction
Classification model to predict the winner of a chess game, using records of ~20,000 games from Lichess. 

## SQL
- ### Pizza Place Sales
    Data from a fictional pizza store, with a simple schema containing tables on orders, order_details, pizzas and pizza_types. I use pgADMIN with PostgreSQL to build the schema and import the data from .csv files, and then answer some business questions to practice using SQL.

## R
- ### Strave commutes
    I frequently bike the same route to work in Baltimore, and record my rides using the Strava app. Here I extract the commute rides and look to see if there are certain times of day where the commute is faster.
